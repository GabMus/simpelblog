"Sorry, meant SimpleBlog (jk)"


Making a blog engine is easy. I made one, for fun and to learn.
It's called SimpelBlog, which means that even an illiterate can make one, with a basic knowledge of the tools to use.


For this particlar project I used Django for the backend and Polymer for the frontend.

The default superuser username is "defaultsuperuser" and the password is "changeme".
Captain obvious hints that you have to change the default password before you deploy the blog. To do this use the following command:
`python manage.py changepassword defaultsuperuser`


Please notice that this project doesn't provide any warranty, it's released as is, for public fruition and enjoyment.


Also take some time to read the GNU GPL v.3 license, provided in this repository, and make sure to be following it when you use this project.


Finally, to avoid giving an incomplete final product, this project is already set up as a scaffold, with sample names, some of my brandings (Tech Pills logo and name here and there) categories and what not, so make sure to edit the source code properly before deployment.
